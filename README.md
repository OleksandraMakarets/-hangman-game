# The Hangman Game

Hangman is the ultimate test of your linguistic prowess, your ability to decipher cryptic messages, and your knack for escaping perilous situations. It's a game that separates the wordsmiths from the wordless wonders and the puny from the pun-masters.

This text-based incarnation of Hangman offers a delightful distraction from the mundane, a chance to pit your wits against a randomly selected word while dangling precariously on the brink of victory or certain doom. Whether you're a cunning linguist, a master of mirth, or just someone looking to procrastinate with purpose, Hangman has something for everyone.

The game runs in the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.
